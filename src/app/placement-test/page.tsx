    title: "The Future of Renewable Energy",
    content: `The global transition to renewable energy sources has accelerated dramatically in recent years. Solar and wind power have become increasingly cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels, leading many countries to revise their energy policies.

In 2023, renewable energy accounted for nearly 30% of global electricity generation, a significant increase from just 20% a decade earlier. This growth has been driven by technological improvements, government incentives, and growing public awareness of climate change.

Solar energy, in particular, has seen remarkable advances. The efficiency of photovoltaic cells has improved substantially, while manufacturing costs have decreased by over 80% since 2010. Many experts predict that solar power will become the cheapest source of electricity in most countries within the next decade.

Wind power has also experienced significant growth. Offshore wind farms, which can generate electricity more consistently due to stronger and more reliable winds at sea, have become increasingly popular in Europe and Asia. The United Kingdom, for example, now generates over 10% of its electricity from offshore wind.

However, the transition to renewable energy is not without challenges. The intermittent nature of solar and wind power requires significant investment in energy storage solutions. Battery technology has improved, but large-scale storage remains expensive. Grid infrastructure also needs substantial upgrades to handle the variable output of renewable sources.

Despite these challenges, the momentum toward renewable energy appears unstoppable. Major corporations, cities, and even entire nations have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 or earlier. This shift represents not just an environmental imperative but also an economic opportunity, with millions of jobs being created in the renewable energy sector worldwide.`,
    questions: [
      { question: "According to the passage, what percentage of global electricity was generated by renewable energy in 2023?", options: ["20%", "25%", "Nearly 30%", "35%"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "The passage states that 'In 2023, renewable energy accounted for nearly 30% of global electricity generation.'" },
      { question: "What has contributed to the decrease in solar energy costs?", options: ["Government regulations", "Improved efficiency and reduced manufacturing costs", "Increased fossil fuel prices", "International trade agreements"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "The passage mentions that 'The efficiency of photovoltaic cells has improved substantially, while manufacturing costs have decreased by over 80% since 2010.'" },
      { question: "Why have offshore wind farms become popular?", options: ["They are cheaper to build", "They generate electricity more consistently", "They require less maintenance", "They are closer to cities"], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: "The passage explains that offshore wind farms 'can generate electricity more consistently due to stronger and more reliable winds at sea.'" },
      { question: "What is mentioned as a major challenge for renewable energy?", options: ["Lack of public support", "High cost of solar panels", "The intermittent nature of solar and wind power", "Shortage of skilled workers"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "The passage states that 'The intermittent nature of solar and wind power requires significant investment in energy storage solutions.'" },
      { question: "What does the passage suggest about the future of renewable energy?", options: ["It will likely fail due to high costs", "Only developed countries will adopt it", "The momentum toward it appears unstoppable", "It will remain a minor energy source"], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: "The passage concludes that 'the momentum toward renewable energy appears unstoppable' with many commitments to carbon neutrality." },
